necessary:
- make all officially documented opcodes work
- make a CLI interface
- make a simple debugger that shows the current registers and stack/instruction pointer

possible things for the future:
- add pledge and unveil for OpenBSD
- possibly implement undocumented opcodes
- make a GUI interface
  - (with high abstraction so it can be ported to as many graphics libraries as possible, with a priority for SDl2/raylib)
